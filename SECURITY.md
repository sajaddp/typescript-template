# Security Policy

Thank you for helping keep this project secure. This document explains how to report vulnerabilities and what to expect from our responsible disclosure process.

## Supported Versions

- Latest released version
- `main` branch

For template repositories like this, security fixes typically land on `main` and are released promptly.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security issues privately. Do not open a public issue.

- Preferred: create a private GitHub Security Advisory:
  https://github.com/sajaddp/typescript-template/security/advisories/new
- Include clear reproduction steps, impact, affected scope, environment details, and any minimal PoC or scripts needed.

There is no dedicated security email at this time; please use Security Advisories.

## Response Timeline

- Acknowledgment: within 48 business hours
- Triage and remediation plan: within 3–7 business days (severity-dependent)
- Fix/mitigation release: within 1–2 weeks (faster for critical issues)

We may contact you for clarification during triage and will keep you updated on progress.

## Responsible Disclosure

- Please avoid public disclosure until a fix or advisory is available.
- We will coordinate public timing and, if you wish, credit you after resolution.

## Scope

This policy covers only the code and configurations contained in this repository.

## Safe Harbor

We encourage good-faith security research. If you follow the guidelines below, your research should not be considered a policy violation:

- Do not cause harm, service degradation, or data manipulation.
- Respect privacy; access only what is necessary and do not disclose data.
- Do not exfiltrate sensitive/personal data; include only minimal evidence.
- Limit testing to assets within this repository and authorized environments.

If you are unsure about scope or rules, contact us first via a Security Advisory.

## Acknowledgments

We appreciate your time and effort. With your permission, we may credit you in release notes once the issue is resolved.
